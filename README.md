# Neural-Networks-for-Stock-Returns-prediction

Project examining the effectiveness of Neural Networks for stock return prediction. The features used consist of fundamental and macro economic variables, accounting for a total of 36 variables. 
Neural Networks are benchmarked against Lasso predictions on the same features and the results show Neural Networks to outperform Lasso.
